## The Pragmatic Programmer (ISBN: 978-0-13-595705-9)

Chapter 8: Before the Project

- In the old days, because of computer's constraints and cost, programmers automated only things which were researched
  inside-out. This is not a reality of today, when customers themselves don't know what they need.
- Receiving initial requirements from customers is in fact an invitation to explore. Developers should raise a flag when
  they see that the requirement may be destructive for customer's business. Inexperienced developers start implementing
  initial requirements.
- Give customers some mockups and prototypes to play with on the early stage. Work in short iterations. **Receive
  feedback**.
- Step in the shoes of application users: When creating an application for helpdesk, spend some time working with people
  answering phone calls.
- When seeing a requirement like _only supervisors and HR should have access to employee's personal data_, developers
  should automatically think about some configurable access control.
- Good software should be intuitive to users and requirements should take it into consideration. A bad example is a
  software for DJs requiring them to use keyboard and mouse while they developed a feedback loop between their consoles
  and their brains.
- Documents should not be a deliverable to customers.
- Customers are focused on solving high-level problems. They use programmers because they pay attention to details and
  nuances.
- Many projects fail because of a _feature bloat_. The solution is to work with customers in short iterations, gathering
  feedback constantly.
- All parties involved in a project (customers, engineers, support staff) should use a common glossary.
- Solving complex problems is not about working inside or outside a box, it's about finding the box, understanding the
  true and real constraints.
- Trojan Horse is a good analogy: it was clear, that conquering a city through the front door was considered a suicide.
- When stuck solving an impossible puzzle, stop for a while and do something else, something mindless. Try explaining a
  problem to someone else.
- Working together means cooperating **during coding**, not only asking questions and attending meetings. Try pair
  programming/mob programming inviting a PM.
- Agile manifesto says: individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working code over comprehensive
  documentation. Whenever someone tells _do this/use this tool, and you will be agile_, is wrong. Being agile means
  being adaptive to changes.
- Take small steps, evaluate, repeat. Recursively, at every level of work.
- Practice design, since good design is easy to change.
