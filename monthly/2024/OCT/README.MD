- _Hippocampus_ is responsible for remembering facts. During sleep information is transferred to _cerebral cortex_.
  Thanks to that hippocampus is cleared and ready to take new information. Damaging hippocampus results in amnesia.
- If one doesn't learn anything new, neurons created in hippocampus die shortly after being created.
- __Physical activity__ results in creating _BDNF_, a chemical which is responsible for creating strong synapses. It
  also produces _dopamine and serotonin_ which help creating new ideas.
- __Healthy diet__ is required to support learning naturally.
