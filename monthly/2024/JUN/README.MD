Chapter 1: The problem with passion

- Brains change their structure depending on what we do with them
- Following only passion (things we're good at and which come easy) reduces opportunities, including relationships,
  things which happen to us in life
- It's OK to follow passions, but broadening them open many new opportunities
- Learning new things we don't know may be interesting is an adventure
- Brain is a toolkit we learn how to use in our lives, as we learn not to use hammer to turn a screw
- Reading a new chapter should start with _picture walking_ through it, visiting sections headings, bold text, summary,
  trying to answer questions at the end of chapters; it gives the brain an idea of what's coming, like checking a map
  before starting a journey
