Chapter 7: School bags, lockers, and your attentional octopus

- Working memory is like a school bag: it holds only limited number of things, which can fall off.
- Long-term memory is like a school locker - it fits much more stuff which is sometimes hard to find.
- Working memory, an attentional octopus, is located in the pre-frontal context of the brain, just above eyes. Long-term
  memory is distributed across entire brain. It's impossible to fill it.
- Working memory holds only about 4 threads, things we have in mind right now. It requires focus to keep them. Repeating
  and writing help to hold them. If we don't focus, we may forget names of newly met people just after we heard them.
- Long-term memory stores everything we remember: faces of our friends, layout of our schools etc.
- There are techniques to help remember more easily.
