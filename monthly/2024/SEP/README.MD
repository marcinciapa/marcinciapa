Chapter 7: School bags, lockers, and your attentional octopus

- Working memory is like a school bag: it holds only limited number of things, which can fall off.
- Long-term memory is like a school locker - it fits much more stuff which is sometimes hard to find.
- Working memory, an attentional octopus, is located in the pre-frontal context of the brain, just above eyes. Long-term
  memory is distributed across entire brain. It's impossible to fill it.
- Working memory holds only about 4 threads, things we have in mind right now. It requires focus to keep them. Repeating
  and writing help to hold them. If we don't focus, we may forget names of newly met people just after we heard them.
- Long-term memory stores everything we remember: faces of our friends, layout of our schools etc.
- There are techniques to help remember more easily.

Chapter 8: Slick tricks to build your memory

- Our mind is better in remembering pictures instead of facts, so to better remember information we could turn them to
  pictures, ideally moving or ridiculous.
- There are five tricks helping to train memory:
    - Focus while learning something
    - Practice
    - Turn information into pictures
    - Anchor new things to those you already know
    - Recall
- While memorizing sequence of new things, turn them into mnemonics.
- Memory palace is a powerful technique. Put information you want to remember to the layout of place you know very well,
  like your apartment. It works because our visuospatial memory is one of the most developed.
- There are additional useful techniques:
    - Make a song about the information
    - Create metaphors
    - Make notes, ideally handwritten
    - Imagine you are the thing you want to learn
    - Turn digits into representative shapes
    - Teach others
    - Sleep
- Additional particularly useful technique is the Rubber Duck technique: Explain things to the rubber duck.

Chapter 9: Why brain-links are important

- Brain links are strong neural connections, which allow to solve complex problem almost automatically, without paying
  too much attention.
- Deep understanding is not enough to build brain links, intensive practice is required.
- Brain links work as long as there is not too much information, external factors, cognitive load, which require putting
  additional attention.
- Focus is required for building brain links, disruption puts us away from achieving the goal.
- Context switching is expensive for our brains, they quickly become tired.
- Enjoyment comes after learning new things deeply. Every new thing seems hard when we first start learning it.
