Chapter 3: I'll do it later, honest!

- Thinking about unpleasant things we postpone for later causes painful feeling. The pain goes away immediately after we
  start working on them.
- While doing a pomodoro don't focus on finishing a task. The goal is to be focused during ~25min time.
- Multitasking is a bad idea. Human can effectively work on only single task in the same time.
- Postponing procrastination for later can be a useful mental trick.
- Create good habits to eliminate bad habits: if you have a habit to check vibrating phone, create a habit to turn on
  'don't disturb' mode when starting working.
- Little procrastinations seem innocent, but if they become habit, they have overall damaging effect on our efficiency.
- Active recall is another learning technique - go back to learned content trying to recall the key ideas, ideally out
  of memory.
