## Learning How to Learn (ISBN: 978-0-52-550446-7)

Chapter 13: Asking yourself important question: Should you listen to music while you're studying?

- Watch yourself learning, make observations, like "Does music help?". Verify what works and what doesn't.
- It's a good practice to change places while learning. Otherwise, the brain is ready to work only in a single place.
- Don't use only your favorite style of learning (whatever it is: visual, by touch). Otherwise, we will not be able to
  use all of them. We learn most efficiently when engaging all senses.
- Sleep is very important, even staying awake create toxins in brain. During sleeping the cells shrink and wash all
  poison. Even a nap helps, it clears the hippocampus.
- Eat your frog first.
- __Set up quitting time__ to learn effectively. 
- Music (not loud, with no words) may be helpful or damaging. It's important to make observations.
