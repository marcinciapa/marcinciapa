Chapter 14: Mentoring, apprenticeship and craftsmanship

- Universities can give a great education, but it's also possible to finish college with diploma and nothing else.
  Anyway, universities do not prepare graduates for what they find in the business.
- Usually we remember our first working programs, because they changed our lives.
- We should not expect good things coming out if we leave inexperienced young people to themselves. It's required to
  support them with reasonable time of supervised practice.
- In our industry we're missing the mindset of training inexperienced juniors.
- We have to be aware, that shaping a new generation of professionals is our responsibility, not universities'.

The book is finished. I 100% recommend. It's about soft skills and mind set such desirable in our profession.
