## Learning How to Learn (ISBN: 978-0-52-550446-7)

Chapter 15: How to do well on tests

- Taking tests is very helpful for learning. It's like a very intensive memory recall.
- Tackle the hardest questions first. After getting stuck for one or two minutes, disconnect, take easier questions, and
  get back to hard ones later.
- When getting stressed, think about it as how exciting taking the test must be. Such inversion is motivating.
- To overcome panic, take a few deep breaths - let the belly breath together with the chest. __Practicing active recall
  before the test also helps to reduce stress__.
- __Sleep is the most important factor before taking the test__.
- After solving the problem, __check if the result intuitively makes sens__.
- Think about questions that the teacher can possibly put on test. Surprisingly, such predictions are usually pretty
  accurate.

From the Preface to the First Edition

- __Pragmatic__ (lat. _pragmaticus_ - skilled in business)(gr. _πραγματικός_ - fit for use)
- Software is a craft - we know how to force computers to do what we want
- We should not stick to a single technology, but know a lot of them and know when to apply which
- Theory and practice combined bring benefits
- Pragmatic developers:
    - are keen on trying new things, integrate them with rest of their knowledge
    - ask questions a lot
    - usually first seek facts instead of assuming things
    - deeply understand nature of problems, which helps them to assess how difficult problems are to solve
    - learn new technologies often
    - __develop software only if care about doing it right__
    - __think about their work, every single decision__
- In a project there is always a place for individuality
- __Kaizen__ should be our motto - improve solution a bit every single time
- Kaizen also applies to individuals - constantly improving knowledge
