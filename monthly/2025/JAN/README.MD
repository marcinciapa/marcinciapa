Chapter 15: How to do well on tests

- Taking tests is very helpful for learning. It's like a very intensive memory recall.
- Tackle the hardest questions first. After getting stuck for one or two minutes, disconnect, take easier questions, and
  get back to hard ones later.
- When getting stressed, think about it as how exciting taking the test must be. Such inversion is motivating.
- To overcome panic, take a few deep breaths - let the belly breath together with the chest. __Practicing active recall
  before the test also helps to reduce stress__.
- __Sleep is the most important factor before taking the test__.
- After solving the problem, __check if the result intuitively makes sens__.
- Think about questions that the teacher can possibly put on test. Surprisingly, such predictions are usually pretty
  accurate.
