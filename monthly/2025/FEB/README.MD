## The Pragmatic Programmer (ISBN: 978-0-13-595705-9)

Chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy

- Put the problem you're currently working on in a broader context, don't solve it in isolation.
- Take responsibility for your actions. When bad things happen, communicate clearly, approach it with professionalism.
  Have a contingency plan for risks. Propose solutions instead of justifications.
- Your Team should trust you. Answer all emails, don't pretend you forget about things.
- Don't leave broken windows behind. Fix them as soon as you notice them.
- Make a stone soup: when there is a resistance to proceed with an interesting project, propose a basic, useless
  solution, people will gather and help you to extend it themselves.
- Don't be a boiled frog, keep yourself aware of things around: don't get stuck with your outdated knowledge.
- In reality, we produce an imperfect code. Keep users involved in project decisions, listen to their feedback. Users
  favor using incomplete programs instead of waiting for a perfect solution forever.
- Don't overcomplicate your solution. Know when to stop and leave your good enough code for a while. This rule doesn't
  justify bad practices.
- Keep your knowledge up to date. Take care of your knowledge the same way as investors care about their portfolio:
    - invest regularly as a habit,
    - diversify between high risk high gain and safe, predictable assets,
    - make adjustments to your portfolio,
    - buy low and sell high,
    - review it and balance regularly
- If you don't know answer for some question, take it as a challenge and find out.
- Think of spoken/written language as yet another programming language: Apply rules like DRY, readability. Respect your
  audience's priorities. Listen to others if you want them to listen to you. Visually prepare documents and
  presentations very well.
- Documentation should be updated hand-by-hand with the code.
